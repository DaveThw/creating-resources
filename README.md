# Creating Resources

A short guide for educators and trainers intending to create learning material on GitHub for their own use and/or towards being included on the [Raspberry Pi website](http://www.rasperrypi.org/resources/).

Before creating or submitting a resource, it is important to know what you're aiming to achieve, who the resource is for, how the information is presented, to what extent you would like to share the materials and whether you would mind others adapting it to suit their own purpose.

## Teach, Learn or Make

It is important to know what type of resource you're creating. On the Raspberry Pi website, our resources fall in to one of three categories: **Teach**, **Learn** and **Make**.

### Teach

*Teach* resources are schemes of work matching the curriculum, with details such as programme of study, learning objectives and learning outcomes.

### Learn

*Learn* resources are materials which work well as a one-off lesson, workshop or individual exercise.

### Make

*Make* resources are materials which involve building or creating something physical, and usually involve hardware or creating multimedia.

## GitHub

GitHub is a software projects hosting service – it's a kind of social networking site for code projects. It uses version control software Git to manage changes in projects, and allows collaboration over the web.

## Markdown

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax. It's very simple, and it maintains its readability while offering a range of formatting options. Our documentation and educational resources are written in markdown and we encourage others to use it for any resources they write themselves and submit to us.

See the [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) on GitHub for reference.

## Structure

A typical **Learn** or **Make** resource repository may take the following format:

- README.md
    - The index page introducing the material, the purpose of the exercise and providing details of any installation, setup instructions and equipment required
- worksheet.md
    - The worksheet containing the instructions for the exercise broken down in to appropriate steps
- LICENCE.md
    - Details of the licence of the materials
- CONTRIBUTING.md
    - Information for contributors to the materials

The repository may also include a folder for code files, scripts and other downloadable assets, and may contain an images folder for any images embedded in the information pages or worksheets. Multiple worksheets can be used, and would be linked to from the index page.

A typical **Teach** resource repository may contain an overall index page along with several folders containing similar contents to the **Learn** and **Make** resources, with more detail and presented in a greater structure.

## Licence

At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we want to maximise the potential reach and application of all the resources we create, so all our own materials are released under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licence.

> A CC [Creative Commons] license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use and build upon a work that they have created.
>
> ~ [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license)

The licence we use is [CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) (attribution and share-alike), which is the licence used by Wikipedia.

### Choosing a licence

You are free to select whatever licence you feel comfortable, and you are entitled to use the methods described in this document without sharing your work. If you would like to share your resources with other educators, we would recommend you follow our lead and use CC BY-SA.

Submissions of resources appreciated, provided they are available under a Creative Commons license such as CC BY-SA. Please contact us for more information.

#### Software licences

Creative Commons covers use of creative works such as written material, music or photography. Software projects use a different set of licences which state the use and distribution of software. Such licences are suitable for software libraries or products/services, but small examples of code used in the context of a learning resource can be covered by the Creative Commons licence relating to the creative works.

In most cases, software licences would be uneccesary in learning resources, but if you created a general purpose software library to go with your resource, you should look at choosing an appropriate licence for the library.

For example, Sonic Pi has the [MIT Licence](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and the `python-picamera` module has the [BSD Licence](https://github.com/waveform80/picamera/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

Refer to [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/) for more information, or feel free to contact us.

## Submission

If you intend to write a Raspberry Pi learning resource to share with the community, we recommend you follow our guidelines and submit to us to review and potentially include on the website.

Once you have your resource ready to submit, email the URL of the GitHub repository to contributions@raspberrypi.org.

Alternatively, if you have resources prepared in another format we can use (Word document or text file – not PDF), you can send these to the same email address. Note such submissions will take longer to process.

We retain the right not to use contributions.

### Process

If we decide you to include your resource on our website, will will fork the project in to the [raspberrypilearning](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning) GitHub organisation. We may make amendments to this copy, and yours will be left as it was, with the option of merging our changes in to your original copy.

At the time of writing there is currently no named attribution on our Resources page, but the name of the author is given on the project's front page. We intend to better highlight author and contributor names on the website in near future.

## Contact

Feel free to speak to us about resources, GitHub, licences and so on - we'll try to help with any queries.
