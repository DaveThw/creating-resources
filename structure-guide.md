# Repository structure

A typical **Learn** or **Make** resource repository may take the following format:

- README.md
    - An index page introducing the material and the purpose of the exercise, providing details of any installation, setup instructions, and equipment required.
- worksheet.md
    - A worksheet containing the instructions for the exercise, broken down into appropriate steps.
- LICENCE.md
    - Details of the licence of the materials.
- CONTRIBUTING.md
    - Information for contributors to the materials.

The repository may also include a folder for code files, scripts and other downloadable assets, and may contain an images folder for any images embedded in the information pages or worksheets. Multiple worksheets can be used, and should be linked to from the index page.

A typical **Teach** resource repository may contain an overall index page along with several folders containing similar contents to the **Learn** and **Make** resources, with more detail and presented within a greater structure.
