# Using Git

GitHub's web interface can be used for a great deal of tasks, but some things require using git on your computer either with a GUI or using the command line.

GitHub's editor is suitable for small additions and modifications but for writing substantial amounts of material it is advisable to use an offline editor and commit using git on your computer.
