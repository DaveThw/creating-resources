# Licences

At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we want to maximise the potential reach and application of all the resources we create, so all our own materials are released under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licence.

> A CC [Creative Commons] license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use and build upon a work that they have created.

## Choosing a licence

You are free to select whatever licence you feel comfortable with, and you are entitled to use the methods described in this document without sharing your work. If you would like to share your resources with other educators, we would recommend you follow our lead and use the CC BY-SA licence as above.

Submissions of resources are appreciated, provided they are available under a Creative Commons license such as CC BY-SA. Please [contact us](http://www.raspberrypi.org/contact-us/) for more information.

## Software licences

Creative Commons covers use of creative works such as written material, music or photography. Software projects use a different set of licences which state the use and distribution of software. Such licences are suitable for software libraries or products/services, but small examples of code used in the context of a learning resource can be covered by the Creative Commons licence relating to the creative works.

In most cases, software licences would be unnecessary in learning resources, but if you created a general-purpose software library to go with your resource, you should look at choosing an appropriate licence for the library.

For example, Sonic Pi uses the [MIT Licence](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and the `python-picamera` module uses the [BSD Licence](https://github.com/waveform80/picamera/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
